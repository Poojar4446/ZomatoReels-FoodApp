# ZomatoReels-FoodApp
This is a full-stack food ordering and delivery platform built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It features a unique, modern component: a 'Food Reels' feed, inspired by TikTok, where food partners can upload vertical videos to visually showcase their dishes, effectively driving user engagement and increasing direct orders.
